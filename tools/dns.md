# DNS

**Attention** DNS can only link to addresses. No ports!

## Subdomain

To link a subdomain to a specific address, simply add a new DNS entry of type A with the name of the subdomain and link it to the desired address. Be aware that http will be directed to http, etc.

| Port | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| 22   | ssh   |
| 443  | https |
| 80   | http  |
